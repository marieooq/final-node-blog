## :pencil2: Description
A CRUD blog application using React, Node.js, and MongoDB. It enables users to create, read, update, and delete the post of the blog. This is a team project. My role is building UI design and router that uses express(Node.js framework).<br>
<br>
Even if users don't have an account nor log in, all of them can read the articles that already posted. If users create an account and log in to this app, they can write a new article and update or delete the posts belong to them.
